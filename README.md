## Key Features
- Automated SEC API integration with fallback logic  
- Revenue growth (CAGR) and profitability ratios  
- Valuation metrics (PE, PEG) with error handling  
- Comparison dashboards across Tesla, Nvidia, and Ford  
- Exportable CSV and PDF report

### Valuation (P/E and PEG)
- **Nvidia**: P/E ~95, PEG ~268 â†’ expensive, but partially justified by strong growth.  
- **Tesla**: P/E ~939, PEG not meaningful due to negative CAGR.  
- **Ford**: Reported a net loss, so valuation ratios were not reliable.
